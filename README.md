# Acknowledges

This repository has been built on top of the following two repositories:

- [clear-diffusion-keras](https://github.com/beresandras/clear-diffusion-keras)
- [Conditional_Diffusion_MNIST](https://github.com/felix-ky/Conditional_Diffusion_MNIST)

Without them the development of this repository and the experiments would have been impossible. Therefore, I would like to acknowledge and thank them for their excellent code.
